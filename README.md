# Deployment Instructions
The environment is basically the same as in all other labs, we have not used any
additional special libraries or anything else.
To start up the project just import the WAR file into Eclipse and
run the init_all.sql file that is located in P4/src/main/resources/sql to
setup the DB.
To run the project run MainController.java on a Apache Tomcat version, we
used Tomcat v9.0 as in all other labs.
To login you can register or use a previous user, but you won't be admin.
You can also log in with our preset users, the password is 'ssssss' for all
of them. For example:
Admins: CristianFedez, HelenaPruna, PatoLucas, moni
Registered users: eulaCraus, meri, Joan, Taixes, poch
