# Deployment Instructions
The final Unitter project is under the P4_delivery/ folder.
To run the project run MainController.java on a Apache Tomcat version, we
used Tomcat v9.0 as in all other labs.

Run the init_all.sql file to initialize the DB with our predefined data.
To login you can register or use a previous user, but you won't be admin.
You can also log in with our preset users, the password is 'ssssss' for all
of them (just for testing purposes).
For example:
Admins: CristianFedez, HelenaPruna, PatoLucas, moni
Registered users: eulaCraus, meri, Joan, Taixes, poch
